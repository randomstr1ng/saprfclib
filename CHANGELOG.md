## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-20

First public release. Beta: the offline test suite passes against byte-exact golden
fixtures captured from live SAP systems, but the public API may still change before 1.0.

### Added

- Pure-Python implementation of the SAP RFC wire protocol — client and server, with no
  SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK, no C compiler, and no native dependencies.
- ABAP type codec covering the RFCTYPE surface: CHAR, NUM, DATE, TIME, BCD, FLOAT,
  INT/INT1/INT2/INT8, BYTE, XSTRING, STRING, STRUCTURE, TABLE, UTCLONG, UTCSECOND,
  UTCMINUTE, DTDAY, DTWEEK, DTMONTH, TSECOND, TMINUTE, CDAY.
- NI/TCP transport, sans-I/O session state machine, and logon handshake.
- Synchronous RFC client with DDIC metadata introspection and in-process caching.
- RFC server: gateway registration and inbound call dispatch.
- Thread-safe bounded connection pool.
- tRFC / qRFC / bgRFC with pluggable durable stores.
- SNC (X.509 / Kerberos) via a user-supplied GSS-API library, loaded at runtime — no
  install-time dependency.
- WebSocket RFC (SAP BTP / cloud) over `wsproto` + `h11`.
- SAProuter route strings and message-server group logon.
- Async-native client, pool, and server APIs alongside the synchronous facade.
- Wire-protocol documentation and a byte-exact golden-fixture test suite.
- `py.typed` marker — the package ships its type information.

### Known limitations

- **DECFLOAT16 / DECFLOAT34 are not implemented.** The wire encoding is unconfirmed, so
  `encode` and `decode` raise `NotImplementedError` rather than risk silently corrupting
  decimal values. Calling a function module with a DECFLOAT parameter will fail.
- **SNC SSO2 token mode is not supported** — `snc_sso=True` raises
  `NotImplementedError`. Certificate and Kerberos SNC are unaffected, and inbound frames
  carrying extension headers parse correctly.
- **SNC acceptor (server) role is not implemented** — client/initiator only.
- The negative BCD sign nibble and the non-Unicode STRUCTURE offset layout are documented
  but unconfirmed on the wire. See the [protocol
  documentation](https://randomstr1ng.github.io/saprfclib/protocol/serialization/) for the
  full gap list.

  it inside a closed-source product carries no obligation on your code.
- The distribution and import name is `saprfclib` — `pip install saprfclib`,
  `import saprfclib`. The name `saprfc` on PyPI belongs to an unrelated, long-abandoned
  project and is not this library.
